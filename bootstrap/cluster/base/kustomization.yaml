  # The "oauth" component deploys basic htpasswd based authentication.
  # This is allows us to login as "root" to the cluster before we sync
  # any ArgoCD applications.
  #
  # The groups components adds the user "root" to the groups "cluster-admins".
  # This grants the "root" user full access to ArgoCD.
